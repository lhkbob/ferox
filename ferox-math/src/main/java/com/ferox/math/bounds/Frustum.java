/**
 * <p/>
 * Frustum represents the mathematical construction of a frustum. It is described as a 6
 * sided convex hull, where at least two planes are parallel to each other. It supports
 * generating frustums that represent perspective projections (a truncated pyramid), or
 * orthographic projections (a rectangular prism).
 * <p/>
 * Each frustum has a direction vector and an up vector. These vectors define an
 * orthonormal basis for the frustum. The two parallel planes of the frustum are specified
 * as distances along the direction vector (near and far). The additional planes are
 * computed based on the locations of the four corners of the near plane intersection.
 * <p/>
 * The mapping from world space to frustum space is not as straight-forward as is implied
 * by the above state. Frustum provides the functionality to get the {@link
 * #getProjectionMatrix() project matrix} and {@link #getViewMatrix() modelview matrix}
 * suitable for use in an OpenGL system. The camera within an OpenGL system looks down its
 * local negative z-axis. Thus the provided direction in this Frustum represents the
 * negative z-axis within camera space.
